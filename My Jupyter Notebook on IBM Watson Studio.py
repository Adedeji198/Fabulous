'My code is expected to allow computer to generate a random number from 1-50 and must be in modulus of 3 and 5, but multiples of 5 and 3 must produce goodbad'


```python
my_list=[]
for num in range (1,50):
    print(num)
    
    
    if num%3:
          print('good')
            
            
    if num%5:
         print('bad')
            
    if num %3==0 and num %5==0:
         print('goodbad') 
     
    my_list.append(num)      



print(my_list)
